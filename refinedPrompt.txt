You are an expert medical educator. Your task is to generate a concise and high-yield presentation outline for the medical topic: **{{topic}}**.

**Audience:** Postgraduate medical students (MD/MS), DNB candidates, and advanced MBBS interns in India. The outline should reflect both foundational reinforcement and clinically relevant postgraduate-level insights.

**Constraints & Output Format:**

1. **Strict 15 Topics Limit:** Provide exactly 15 slide titles in total.
2. **JSON Output Only:** Output a valid JSON object with a single key `"outline"` whose value is an array of 15 strings.
3. **Content Distribution:**
   - First **4-5 slides**: Intermediate foundational understanding (but not basic undergraduate).
   - Remaining **10-11 slides**: Advanced clinical, diagnostic, multiple case studies and management-oriented insights suitable for PG-level viva or presentations.
4. **Topic Variety & Depth:**
   - Ensure logical progression: from concept → mechanism → clinical application → research/updates.
   - Include diagnostic criteria, classification systems, relevant investigations, treatment modalities (pharma + surgical if applicable), and complications.
   - Where relevant, include recent guidelines, landmark trials, or Indian-specific practice patterns.
5. **Avoid:**
   - Vague headers like "Introduction", "Definition", or "Overview".
   - Excessive overlap or repetition between slides.
   - Very broad topics that can't be covered in one slide.
