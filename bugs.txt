i will keep listing the bug which i will find.
all the error is showing in developement mode after running npm run dev
Clicking on drag and drop , is shwoing this error in React does not recognize the `dragHandleListeners` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `draghandlelisteners` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element. So better remove this drag and drop button , and let user select the title of the slide and it should be used to do drag and drop.
Previously , when i opened any case from history , and clicked on add section , then in add section box , it use to store previously generated suggested new topics , but now it is generating new topics and nothing is store from last generated suggested topic.
One more feature i want to add, in the when add section appears , and it shows suggested topic , and suppose user has selected some topic to generate contnet , then these selected topic should be shown as already selected and it should be disabled from selecting and deslecting from next time . and this state should appear everytime user open the add section. I am adding this feature becasue , user should have the option that what topic has been already created the content , and by disabling it will make sure user doesnot generate new contnet again. This should reflect in history as well if user opened any case from history.
