earlier i wanted to create new feature based on the detail given in @newFeature.txt , it created features, but it was not working the way i had thought , so i kept adding detail bug after each implementation in the same file @newFeature.txt . i asked created a new comprehensive document , in which it has been written  how they will implement the feature , so gemini created a document @FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and wrote in detail. ther are two  more document called @PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md and @PROJECT_FUNCTIONALITY.md , in which it has the information about how earlier feature was working . please go through the entire code base and see why the new feature is not working as expected . for your simplicity , i think it mostly depends on how prompt is writtten in @src\ai\flows directory , and how data is being saved in firebase and how our prompt and fronted is using this data for each specific functioanlity . To compare , how original code was working you can go to main branch if you found any confusion
